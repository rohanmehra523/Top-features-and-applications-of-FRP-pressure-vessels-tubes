Due to the shortage of fresh water in many regions around the world today, the construction of water purification utilities and in particular seawater desalination plants has become an urgent need. Reverse osmosis is one of the most used technologies for desalinating a large scale of water measured by millions of cubic meters per year. 
Reverse Osmosis (RO) removes salts and impurities from seawater by pushing it through membrane filters. One of the main components of the desalination RO process are fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP) pressure vessels that are used as pressure housing of the reverse osmosis filters. 
FRP is an updated composite material usually used in chemical plant appliances, equipment, and components namely for vessels and tanks. FRP tanks and vessels have numerous useful applications in both industrial and commercial water treatment systems as well. FRP pressure vessels are usually several meters long and operate under high pressure.  
FRP pressure vessels have some remarkable features for which they are used extensively in the industrial sector. They are durable, lightweight, flexible, high strength, corrosion-resistant, and less expensive. FRP pressure vessel manufacturers in India make sure to deliver components that have a variety of beneficial features like:
1.	They are resistant to corrosion and climate change. Thus, the substances and chemicals inside the vessel do not get affected by such conditions.
2.	They are very durable and reliable. As they are fortified by fiber, the strength of the vessel is multiplied by a great extent. 
3.	FRP tanks have a good passing on capacity as a result of their polished inward completion and thus it brings down the pumpâ€™s load. 
4.	They have low thermal conductivity and good abrasive resistivity. 
5.	FRP pressure tubes have good galvanic resistance and fine thermal insulation. 
6.	Mostly they are UV resistant, lightweight as well as flexible in design.
7.	They are adaptable and have good dimensional stability. 
8.	Since they have a high strength-to-weight ratio, they are light in weight but at the same time, quite strong.
9.	They have a good insulating property.
10.	They are economical and cost-effective as compared to metal alternatives. They also last at least 5-10 times longer than stainless steel even in the most extreme corrosive environments.

FRP pressure tubes are mostly used in chemical industries for filtration purposes. In addition to this, they are also used in industries like fertilizer, wood pulp, sewage treatment, and so on. 
Some of the industries where FRP pressure vessels are used are:
1.	Water treatment plant: Fiber-reinforced plastic pressure vessels are used to treat water in treatment plants. It is used for many purposes like in Iron Removal Plant (IRP), Fluoride Treatment Plant (FRP), and Arsenic Treatment Plant (ARP).
2.	Fertilizer Industry: FRP tubes are used in chemical mining for potassium. Potash (potassium) is one of the three fundamental supplements needed by plants for healthy growth. Therefore, it is a key ingredient in the creation of manure/fertilizer and hence in food production. 
3.	Food processing industry: High-pressure processing decreases costs and makes new scope to improve food quality and safety. The nutrients and flavors of the food are not affected by such high pressures at which microorganisms and proteins are deactivated. High pressure increases the quality and shelf-life of the food. As FRP vessels are non-reactive and resistant to corrosion, they are a perfect fit for the food processing industry.
4.	Petroleum industry: FRP pressure vessels are cheap and can withhold a huge amount of pressure, so they are used to store LPG. They are also less expensive and easy to transport, which makes them the preferred option. 
5.	Wood pulp industry: As the fiber-reinforced plastic pressure vessels are lightweight and low maintenance, they can handle a lot of weight and have a long life. Thus, they are used extensively in the wood pulp industry.
6.	Air pollution control equipment: Since FRP vessels have a high ratio of mechanical strength to weight, they have low downtime and longer service life. This makes them a great choice for use as a component in air pollution control equipment. 

Thus, fiber-reinforced plastic pressure tubes are widely used as they are immune to liquids including water as well as harsh chemicals. Thus, many <a href="https://arvindkaigo.com/Pressure-tube-and-Tanks.php">FRP pressure tube manufacturers in India</a> prefer using FRP in water treatment plants. FRP is leak-proof and thus keeps the flow of water smooth. Additionally, it is also flexible and can be thus given any shape and size.
